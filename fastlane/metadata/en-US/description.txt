Colorful Strike Team is a tower defence game set in the village fantasy and you are its defenders. Your job is to mentor a super team of heros and keep your village save from incoming monsters!

A short tutorial gets you up to speed! First get yourself a hero, then merge to upgrade, set the best place on the grid, then handle your first wave then rinse and repeat. To keep the village save you need to complete all levels!

Battles unfold on a clear path to the village. Tap the central spawn button to summon random towers, drag them between tower slots to refine your layout, and use two lifesavers at the bottom—Heart to recover, Bomb for emergency damage. Waves intensify, with bosses appearing at waves 10 and 20.

Colorful Strike Team features 7 types of towers each with its own specials. From Icy Cold ones to slow the enemies to poisonous and crazy ones. Play to find your favorite.

Upgrade the strenght of your defenders by leveling up their stats, which include power, speed, radius. Radius to shoot farther, speed to shoot faster and power to shoot harder!

Plan, merge, and protect your village— Colorful Strike Team awaits!
